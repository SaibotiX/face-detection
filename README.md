# face-recognition
A full face-recognition Software in the making. It is my first real project which could make the world a little better. My goal is to create a Software which is able, with the help of a microcontroller and a little camera to unlock the things you want. May it be some kind of door in your house or just to make your caf√© machine or light switch go insane when it sees you.

The goal is to write as much of the core functuality myself in order to learn the most. I will allow myself to use all the standard libraries, but specific libraries for face-recognition I will not use. 

Smaller steps leads to the result:

Step 1: Create a program which can create and read a .csv file.

Step 2: With the .csv file I will then implement AdaBoost.

Step 3: As far as I understand it right now, the Viola and Jones Method uses the AdaBoost algorythm, but with some tweaks, so now I will rewrite the AdaBoost, so that I can use it with the Viola and Jones face detection algorythm.

Step 4: Make the Integral Image (Maybe I should insert that between step 1 and step 2, but I really like working with nodes so yea, here it is for now)

Step 5: Combine classifiers in a cascade (Whatever a cascade is but yea, future me will figure that out)

Step 6: Combine everything in one HUGE Project
