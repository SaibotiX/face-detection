# face-recognition
A full face-recognition Software in the making. It is my first real project which could make the world a little better. My goal is to create a Software which is able with the help of a Microcontroller and a little Camera to unlock the things you want. May it be some kind of door in your house, a caf√© machine or light switch.

The goal is to write as much of the core functuality myself in order to learn the most. I will allow myself to use all the standard libraries, but specific libraries for face-recognition I will not use.
